# The IRON Founding Doctrine

> **"Code is Law" is a warning, not a slogan.**

## 1. The Mission
To build the **Civilization-Grade Governance Kernel**.
We do not build "DAOs". We do not build "Enterprise Admin Panels".
We build the **physics engine for institutional authority**.

## 2. The Non-Negotiables (Zero-Compromise)

### I. The Anti-Dashboard Rule
IRON is **Infrastructure**, not a Destination.
*   If we are building a React App for end-users, we have failed.
*   IRON is a library you import, not a site you visit.
*   **Success Metric**: `npm install @iron/kernel` is the only interaction 99% of devs have.

### II. The Determinism Pact
*   Governance must be **Replayable**.
*   Given `History` + `Intent`, the result must **always** be identical.
*   No randomness. No external API calls in the Kernel. No "AI Judgement" without cryptographic binding.

### III. The Commercial Boundary (The Linux Model)
We monetize **Safety**, not *Utility*.
*   **Utility** (State, Auth, Protocols) is Free/Open.
*   **Safety** (Audit, Simulation, Formal Verification) is Paid/Proprietary.
*   *If the user can shoot their own foot, it's free. If they want a safety holster, it costs.*

## 3. Cultural Axioms

1.  **Strict Typing over "Flexibility"**: Ambiguity is the root of corruption.
2.  **Invariants over Policy**: Don't write a rule saying "Be nice". Write code that makes "Being mean" a compile-time error.
3.  **War-Game Everything**: If we haven't attacked it, it's not secure. (See: Chaos Lab).

# IRON PERFORMANCE: Scope & Boundary Constitution

> **Mandate**: Iron Performance is a **Verifiable Insight Engine**. It exists to transform the raw L2 state ("Truth") into actionable, hierarchical performance metrics, ensuring that "What you see is what actually happened."
> *We govern Truth, not Optics.*

## 1. The Boundary Laws

### 1.1 The Positive Constraints (MUST)
*   **Truth-Backed Only**: Every metric in the Performance system must map to an immutable Evidence Hash in the Audit Log (L5). No "Manual Overrides" without a signed Intent.
*   **Hierarchical Alignment**: Child metrics (Team OKRs) must mathematically or logically derive from or contribute to Parent metrics (Org Goals). 
*   **Real-Time Drift Detection**: The system must flag discrepancies between "Projected Performance" and "Actual State".
*   **Actionable Insights**: Metrics must link to the Protocols (L4) that generated them. Viewing a drop in "Discipline" should allow immediate drill-down to specific "Habit" failures.

### 1.2 The Negative Constraints (NEVER)
*   **No "Green-Washing"**: You cannot hide failing metrics. Visibility is a function of Authority, not political convenience.
*   **No Disconnected Data**: No arbitrary CSV uploads. If the kernel didn't see it, it's not a Performance metric.
*   **No Subjective Guessing**: Leave "Sentiment Analysis" to the Chat tools. Iron Performance is for **Hard Metrics** (Budget, Streak, Compliance, Throughput).

## 2. Core Capabilities (In-Scope)

### 2.1 The Scorecard Tool (L1 Adoption)
*   **Quantified Self**: Personal dashboard of Streaks (Iron Habit) and Authority (Iron Wallet).
*   **The Wedge**: Users get addicted to their own "Governance Score" (Reputation).

### 2.2 Aligned OKRs (L2 System)
*   **Unit Aggregation**: Automated roll-up of individual habits into team performance.
*   **The Ops Glue**: Managers see "Team Velocity" as a cryptographic fact.

### 2.3 Iron Console (L3 Platform)
*   **The Institutional Dashboard**: Unified view of Risk (Domain IV), Authority (Domain V), Coordination (Domain III), and Execution (Domain I).
*   **Monetization**: This is the premium "Executive Suite".

## 3. Approved Evolution Path

1.  **Personal Scorecard (Now)**: "Am I hitting my goals?"
2.  **Team MIS (Next)**: "Is the squad executing the protocol?"
3.  **Institutional Console (Final)**: "Is the venture alive and compliant?"

## 4. Scope Rulings

| Feature Proposal | Verdict | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Manual Performance Rating (1-5)"** | **REJECT** | Subjective. Violates "Verifiable Truth". |
| **"Automated KPI Dashboard"** | **APPROVE** | **Core MIS**. If KPIs pull from L2 metrics. |
| **"Predictive Delay Warning"** | **APPROVE** | **Simulation Integration**. Uses L3 to warn about L2 trends. |
| **"Peer Kudos / Compliments"** | **REJECT** | Out of scope. Not a governance metric. |
| **"Budget v Actuals Report"** | **APPROVE** | **Financial Performance**. Highest value institutional use case. |
